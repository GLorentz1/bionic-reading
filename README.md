# bionic-reading

This repository contains my personal implementation of a script to convert an EPUB into the bionic reading version of it.

## What is Bionic Reading?

## Purpose of the Script

The purpose of this script is to automate the process of converting EPUB files into the bionic reading format. The ebook styling/formatting might be impacted.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `bionic.py` script directly.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:

    ```
    python bionic.py input_file.epub output_file.epub
    ```

   Replace `input_file.epub` with the path to the EPUB file you want to convert, and `output_file.epub` with the desired name and path of the resulting bionic reading EPUB file.

5. Wait for the script to complete the conversion process. Once finished, you will have a new EPUB file in the specified output location that is compatible with bionic reading applications.

Please note that the script may require additional dependencies to be installed. Make sure to review the script's requirements and install any necessary packages before running it.
